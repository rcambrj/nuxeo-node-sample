# nuxeo-node-sample

Sample use of the node.js [Nuxeo client](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-js-client).

# How to run

You can change the values for you own Nuxeo Platform server in the `sample.js` file, and then run the following:

    $ npm install
    $ node sample.js [--dry-run]

The `--dry-run` option will only display the files that will be renamed, without renaming them.
